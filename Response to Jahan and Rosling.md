In his report, Selim Jahan states that human development is a process of enlarging human choices.In order to enhance the choices, there are two sides of it: the capabilities of human beings that have to be enhanced and the opportunities of human beings to use those capabilities that have to be improved. Human development can be represented by an equation. On the left side are the human capabilities. On the right hand side are the opportunities for applying our capabilities. It is the balance between the two, which helps maximizing human development. The world had been preoccupied with opulence. The paradigm of economic growth seemed to be the end of human development. Fortunately, the fist human development report in 1990 shifted the focus of human development. For the first time, people were put at the center of development, at the center of policy debates, policy dialogues, policy discourses, and at the center of extending the frontier of our understanding of people-centered development.

In Jahan's analysis, he claims that human development is development of the people, for the people, and by the people. We wish to develope human capital and human resources. We intend to ensure that people directly benefits from human development. We welcome people as active participants in the process which influences their lives. Then, Jahan highlights three things about the concept of human development. First, although income is a critical ingredient that enhances human development, it is never an end. Second, human development is a holistic notion. It includes more than basic needs and welfare. Futhermore, Jahan introduces Human Development Index. While no measure can capture a concept totally and fully, HDI aims to cover 3 basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and decent standard of living. The other type of measure is the breadth measure. It contains different indicators of human development and displays broader information. Jahan and his team rethinks the definition of work for human development. It begins to include the creative work like arts and literature. Nonetheless, they also encounter certain issues. Gender-related work is quite important. Agriculture or rural development requires attention because they provide job opportunities in spite of urbanization. Lastly, the work during crisis or post-crisis matters because life must go on.


From collecting data for the past decades, Rosling maintains that the improvement of health and lifespan triggers economic development. He selects few countries as examples. China and India, two developing countries that had large families and low income in the last century, display significant increase in aggregate wealth. They gradually become a country with small family size and high life expectancy. Additionally, Rosling compares South Korea to African countries. He points out that South Korea enjoys the advantage of small population and develops much faster than Uganda. Using average data to measure a country's financial status can result in inaccuracy to address realistic problem. One example can be average life expectancy and GDP per capital in African countries. Even within one country such as Uganda, it is possible to see a huge disparity between the richest group and the poorest.
