Definition of human development: Jahan mentions the term named Human Development Index (HDI) which focuses on the basic dimensions of human development. HDI is composed of long-term human development outcomes. His targetted issues include a shift emphasis from the productivity and value individuals can produce to the quality of every person's life. 
From collecting data for the past decades, Rosling maintains that the improvement of health and lifespan triggers economic development. He selects few countries as examples. China and India, two developing countries that had large families and low income in the last century, display significant increase in aggregate wealth. They gradually become a country with small family size and high life expectancy. Additionally, Rosling compares South Korea to African countries. He points out that South Korea enjoys the advantage of small population and develops much faster than Uganda. Using average data to measure a country's financial status can result in inaccuracy to address realistic problem. One example can be average life expectancy and GDP per capital in African countries. Even within one country such as Uganda, it is possible to see a huge disparity between the richest group and the poorest.
