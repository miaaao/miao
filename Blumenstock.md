The rapid development of data science in recent decades bring tremendous changes to people's life, especially people in the developed countries and developing countries. 
Nonetheless, every tool we develop for efficiency has pros and cons. 
Supporters believes that the rise of data science helps people to "repay their debts" and "distribute humanitarian aid." Critiques,however, refutes the effectiveness of new approaches and lists four problems with the tool.
The promise data science provides includes three aspects. First, people who have access to data science own greater credit score because they are able to repay their debt. Moreover, data science allows people to detect patterns of phone calls, whcih can determine if a region is wealthy or not. Once we gather enough data, government and international institutions can distribute supplies in a more scientific way. In addition to poverty, data can pinpoint the spread of disease during epidemics. 
Data science does enable human development, but it can also trigger serious pitfalls. Blumenstock suggests that data science, a tool we develop to solve inequality problem, is actually in the hands of few. While "digital credit" and microloans offers opportunities for us to borrow money, they ignore that poor people have no way to pay it back. Unfortunately, online records, no matter they are accurate or not, can affect people's credibility in reality. Missing payments are likely to prevent the poor from obtaining loans from a bank. Second, data science is too new to be reliable. While traditional methods are less efficient at collecting data, they have experienced corrections and adjustment to yield convincing data. As a new technology, data science make swift progress in generalizing information. Nonetheless, it also suffers from the lack of validation.
