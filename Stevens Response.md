1. In the readings for Monday and today (Stevens et al.) the authors use a technique to produce a high resolution description of the distribution of human populations across the globe. What is the name of the technique and describe in general and basic terms how it works?

To generate high resolution data on human population distributions, the author presents a new modeling approach named “Random Forest” estimation technique. It is a predictive model that offers a weighting scheme by incorporating remotely sensed and geospatial data from different scales. The “Random Forest” approach is highly flexible since it accepts both continuous and discrete covariates. To predict log population density, Random Forest models grow a “forest” of regression trees and improves by selecting the best predictors, achieving a high level of accuracy.

2. The random forest method used by the authors is a machine learning algorithm (ensemble method). In general terms, what is a machine learning algorithm? Within the context of this study what distinguishes a data science, machine learning method (such as random forest) from previous classical statistical approaches to describing and analyzing phenomenon and events?

A machine learning algorithm performs like a statistical model. It analyzes data we provide and makes predictions within an acceptable range. Ensemble methods, such as the Random Forest approach, are more accurate compared to classical statistical approaches because it combines multiple base models and selects the least biased one before generating the final outcome. 

3. In the reading, the authors use a number of geospatial covariates as predictors in their machine learning method. What were these geospatial covariates and approximately how big of a data set did they represent (in general terms)? What is the significance of big data in the estimation of machine learning methods for inferring the correlates and drivers of human population distributions?

The Random Forest algorithm includes several covariate data sets. Some of the covariates are night-time lights, topography, land cover, and climatic information. The reading provides a specific description on calculating how big of a data set each covariate represents. 

4. The authors’ results present a remarkable improvement over previous geospatial descriptions at very high resolution, of the distribution of the human population. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the significance of having a highly accurate description of where each person is located across planet earth?

Having an accurate description of population density is significant when it comes to human development. When disease breaks out, the government is able to trace the root of the pandemic. Resources can be more properly allocated once we gain a reliable estimation of population distribution. Comparing the distribution of the human population in the past allows scientists to assess the change in migration patterns.

5. Within the context of human development in LMICs, what is the relevance to your area of investigation in having a highly accurate description of where each household and person is located across planet earth?

Urbanization relies heavily on population distribution information. The amount of people living within a region determines if the region is urbanized or not. Opposite to rural areas where people are sparsely distributed, an urban area is defined as a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. However, urbanization does not imply prosperity and development. Urbanization in India, the topic I am focusing on, indicates that densely-populated area needs more regulations and help.
