1. Nieves et a. use the random forest machine learning method to predict what value globally? 

The author uses the random forest machine learning method to predict the relationship between population densities and the ancillary datasets that represent the covariates at a sub-national scale. 

2. Describe in detail how random forest works. 

According to the article, RFs are a non-parametric, nonlinear statistical method that falls within a category of machine-learning methods known as ‘ensemble methods.’ This kind of methods take individual decision trees that are considered ‘weak learners’ and combine them to create ‘strong learner’. It uses a regression model that estimates a population layer from input census and covariate data. The first step is the covariate selection. The second step uses all available census units and creates a population density weighting layer from the model. Lastly, we gain a standardization of what each covariate represents for comparisons across models. 

3. What is a dasymmetric population allocation? 

A dasymmetric population allocation observes values to apply to a specific area. It uses density and population counts, which are more generalized. It works by applying data to each grid cells. Compared to census data, it provides more accurate prediction.

4. Which geospatial covariates proved to be the most important when predicting global values of where humans reside?

The result shows that variables related to built/urban areas and to climatic/environmental covariates were the most important for predicting population density. Actually, those variables are the only covariate classes that were significantly more important than others, regardless of the scale of analysis. This finding should not be a surpise since we estimate a 54% of the world’s population live in urbanized area. However, the predicted growth in population and urbanization can be hazardous.
