Question:

In Anderson's 2008 Wired Article he describes how the data deluge is serving to make the scientific theory obsolete. Kitchen provides a rebuttal to Anderson's argument that theory is dead with his supposition that in fact we have entered a fourth paradigm. What do you think? Do you believe theory is dead? Do you think we have indeed entered a paradigm shifting revolution for how we describe, analyze and understand the world?

Answer:

In Anderson's article, he introduces the beginning of the Petabyte Age. This implies that the amount of information and the way we collect data have been revolutionized. The data deluge forces people to think mathematically first and establish a context for it later. "Correlation is not causation" is no longer the case. Massive data creates models that are obsolete. 

In Kitchen's opinion, however, the convenience of Big Data does not affect how science operates. Digital devices generate Big Data continuously, producing diverse and relational figures. Conventionally, we form ideas through data analysis techniques. Today, Big Data offers abundant sources of statistics with great uncertainty, making it difficult to find associations between different data sets. This kind of new model, termed as the fourth paradigm by Kitchen, has its strengths and weaknesses. While we must form a question before making proper analysis, now we can build multiple solutions with exhaustive figures. Under this circumstance, any patterns we detect within Big Data are meaningful and truthful. 

The development of Big Data offers both opportunities and challenges. The new fourth paradigm, which is rooted in data-intensive exploration, confronts the established scientific deductive approach. Empirical data allows numbers to speak for themselves. I totally agree on this point because traditional methods may generate greater biased during research. Scientists tend to use data that favors the hypothesis they predetermine. To get a scientifically significant result, some important figures are ignored. If we get rid of the context and solely look at the data, we can see whether there is a relation or not.
