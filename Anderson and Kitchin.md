Question:

In Anderson's 2008 Wired Article he describes how the data deluge is serving to make the scientific theory obsolete. Kitchen provides a rebuttal to Anderson's argument that theory is dead with his supposition that in fact we have entered a fourth paradigm. What do you think? Do you believe theory is dead? Do you think we have indeed entered a paradigm shifting revolution for how we describe, analyze and understand the world?

Answer:

In Anderson's article, he argues that people are living in the Petabyte Age. The amount of information and the way we collect data have been revolutionized. It forces people to think mathematically first and establish a context for it later. "Correlation is not causation" is no longer the case. Massive data creates models that are obsolete. 

In Kitchen's opinion, however, the convenience of Big Data does not affect how science operates. Digital devices generate Big Data continuously, producing diverse and relational figures. Conventionally, we form ideas through data analysis techniques. In contrast, Big Data offers abundant data with great uncertainty, making it difficult to find associations between different data sets. This kind of new model, termed as the fourth paradigm by Kitchen, has its strengths and weaknesses. While we must form a question before making statistical analysis, now we can build multiple solutions with exhaustive data sources. Under this circumstance, any patterns we detect within Big Data are meaningful and truthful. Some people refute the new mode of science, assert that is based on fallacious thinking.
