Question 8 & 10

8. What is Acemoglu & Robinson’s book? 
-	the book is called Why Nations Fail, which offers a compelling account of why the governance agenda has not lived to its expectations. The author doesn’t like the title because he thinks the interesting questions is why some nations succeed in breaking out of poverty and others don’t. 
-	they argue that mainstream development practice is built on the incorrect assumption. It is incorrect because poor countries don’t have weak institutions not because they don’t know any better, but because it suits the powerful elites to run things this way.
-	The author acknowledges the book’s description of how the politics of nations shape their institutions, but it doesn’t provide the missing ingredient that is crucial to human development. 
-	The previous failed idea bears no resemblance to reality. 
-	Financial investment did not add to Nigeria’s national income due to poor management and endemic corruption. The problem is not about policies but institutions. in addition to provide aid for poor regions, it is also important to make evaluations of the effects of the amount of money.

10. Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-level?
-	Steve jones is a famous evolutionary biologist. He worked in a factory making soap powder, designing a better nozzle, which is a critical component for making soap powder. 
-	The problem is that fluid fynamics are non-linear and that makes it complicated to model. Therefore, Jones tried a different approach. He took the existing nozzle, making copies, and randomly distorted each of them. Then, he tested each variant and measured which one was the best. Eventually it works much better than the nozzle they started with. Since the new nozzle is hundreds of times more efficient. His results were quite significant since a 20% increase in efficiency would be regarded as pretty remarkable.
-	His success implies one characteristic of adaptive change: it doesn’t just bring about small improvements but startling jumps to new solutions.
