**Introduction**

By 2030, sixty percent of the world’s population is expected to live in urban areas. Megacities will serve as economic, cultural, and political hubs of international affairs. Urbanization, therefore, continues to reshape nearly every aspect of modern life. Cities can be places of opportunity, creativity, and innovation. However, slum formation has been a central characteristic of rapid urbanization. Slum conditions create serious economic, social, political and physical insecurities that can spread outward. Uneven urbanization is worrisome for several reasons: crime, endemic poverty, inadequate sanitation systems, etc. To ease urbanization drive, local and national leaders should apply measures to effect change. New urbanization plan must contain approaches that are efficient, inclusive, and sustainable. These include heightened security, more transparent governance, and so forth. 

As a geographically diverse and densely-populated country that has been undergoing an urban transition, India serves an ideal context to develop and test approaches for the detection of features related to urbanization. Rapid rise in urban population in India is leading to many problems like pollution, unemployment, and increasing slums. The country has around 300 million people living in metropolitan areas. With overcrowded cities, many people are forced to live in unsafe conditions. This messy urban planning severely threatens social stability and residents’ living standards. Despite the drastic rise in the rate of urbanization, statistics suggests that over one million of Indians suffer from uneven urban growth. In addition, rural to urban migration demands new resource distribution and balancing food production. 

A lack of reliable datasets, a misunderstanding about urban sprawl process, and an ambiguous classification of urbanization make it hard to conduct urbanization reform. The low availability of transparent data prevents institutions from directing funding and targeting underdeveloped areas. Local governments use it as an excuse for devoting little time to improve urban growth. 

In Amartya Sen’s article, five distinct types of freedom promote human development. The research ensures the enlargement of social opportunities. Moreover, effective urban reforms make economic activities promising, attracting business investment on cities’ infrastructure. The research also produces accurate data to assess the progress of urbanization, achieving transparency guarantees. The future of India’s urbanization not only relies on a robust urban growth, but also an efficient distribution of urban functions.

The research focuses on detecting and predicting urban growth in India. Its purpose is to monitor the progress of urbanization and present urban prediction models. To accomplish the research objective, I have selected two sources with different types of data science methodologies. Gordon Hanson’s work presents a dataset consisting of 21,030 polygons, delineating the entire country. It adopts a pixel-based classification approach and applies Random Forest as classifier. Gnanappazhan Lakshmanan’s article chooses the fourth largest metropolitan cities in India, Chennai, as the study area. The source utilizes neural networks coupled agents-based cellular automata model to predict the complex, non-linear, spatial-temporal process of urban growth.  

**Inquiry Type**

The big research topic of my paper is urbanization in India. This issue evokes questions that can be either explanatory or exploratory. Ultimately, I narrow it down to “what is the rate of urban growth in India under current definition of urbanization,” which leans towards an exploratory inquiry. As meshguides maintains, an exploratory inquiry describes findings from investigating a social phenomenon. Uneven urbanization, facilitated by globalization, is considered as a social process that requires scholars’ research and analysis. Rather than finding the causes of ineffective urban planning, the paper focuses on how urbanization has developed in India and which stage it has entered now. in the process of investigation, sub-questions emerge and help me to complete the research in detail.  The sub-questions have covered different aspects of urbanization. For example, one question measures the significance of the urban sprawl problem; the other one interprets the degree of urbanization; another question is to formulate effective growth patterns by comparing different cities in India. Although these factors are on different scale, they all contribute to answering the central question. 

**Methodology**

Method 1:

Hanson’s study differs from previous efforts in four respects. It first constructs a large-scale georeferenced dataset. Since it includes data at a national scale, the author uses secondary data instead of conducting a survey. Then, it validates the dataset’s applicability for mapping urban areas. Third, it proposes a methodology that is designed to evaluate the performance of the classifiers.  The last step is to conclude a practical procedure for temporal analysis of urban areas. Using satellite images to define urban extents, the author chooses pixel-based classification because it requires less computational power. The classification utilizes a dataset consisting of 21,030 polygons, 30 m x 30 m in size, that are randomly distributed throughout India. With the help of WorldPop, a grid of per-pixel estimates of population densities is depicted in a spatial resolution of 100 m. The article performs pixel-based classification with three types of classifiers and Random Forests is one of them. To assure a fair assessment of the classifier’s generalization, the author divides labeled data into a training set and a test set. The accuracy of each classifier is estimated by the k-fold cross-validation procedure. After assessing the performance of the classifiers, the author will map the classified built-up areas. Each classifier’s performance can be described in a confusion matrix, where the predicted examples are compared with the actual ones. Three performance estimators are presented: (1) overall accuracy rate; (2) precision rate; and (3) recall rate. The purpose of comparing three classifiers is to find one that produces high-quality maps of built-up areas across time and space. After the evaluation of different classifiers, the author uses the classifier to map urban areas across time. The classified image has an advantage to capture various types of land cover and land use, which is impossible for estimates of local area population to accomplish. Cloud-based platforms like GEE makes it feasible to monitor urbanization in multi-spatial and temporal resolutions.

Results:

Random Forest achieves the highest overall accuracy rate with 100 decision trees. It predicts correctly 87.1% of the examples. It is suggested that the number of decision trees of the Random Forest is generally proportional to the classifier’s accuracy, but this pattern holds only up to 100 trees. In addition, Random Forest shows the highest balanced accuracy rate (79.7%) with 10 decision trees. The author also evaluates different classifiers at the geographical level of agro-climatic zones. Undoubtedly, Random Forest again shows the best performance with a 66% True-positive rate. These results confirm that Random Forest is capable of making accurate prediction even at a large scale. In fact, increasing decision trees can improve the accuracy of its output.

Method 2:

To address unplanned urbanization that is harmful to both environment and mankind, Lakshmana uses three prediction modeling techniques to predict future urban growth. Neural Network model is one of them and is proved to be the better one with higher Kappa coefficient. Ranging from -1 to +1, Kappa coefficient is a statistical measure of interrater reliability. Similar to the first method, Neural Network coupled Agents- based Cellular Automata model (NNACA) contains temporal dimension as well as spatial parameters. Integrating with CA models, neural networks are now used for predicting urban land uses. CA consists of 5 basic elements: Cell Space, Cell State, Cell Neighborhood, Transition Rule, and Time. NNACA model does not require Transition Rule, a subjective factor that affects the level of accuracy. Unlike the first source which analyzes the entire country, this article selects Chennai as the study area. The study region encompasses 645km2 area and a population of 486000 according to 2011 census. This also indicates that the source uses secondary data. The three models predict based on the urban maps of the study region using 2009 and 2013 data. NNACA model makes use of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which consists of an input layer, several hidden layers, and an output layer. The author feeds all the 12 agents into the MLP as input neurons. A formula of 2n/3, where n=12, suggests that 8 hidden neurons must be used. The output layer should have 2 neurons namely built-up and non-built-up. After this, the author runs the model for 10000 iterations with dynamic learning rate. Normally, the accuracy rate must exceed 80% to be acceptable. After carrying out different modeling, it is important to assess accuracy in the validation process. The article reports accuracies of the classified land cover maps. It reveals a significant increase in built-up from 2009 to 2016. Comparisons demonstrate that other two techniques overpredict urban growth especially with hotspots. To improve the efficiency, more agents are added to the models. However, the prediction outputs stay the same.

Results:

NAACA model reports an accuracy rate of 90% in the present study. Moreover, the model has the highest efficiency among three techniques. During the learning process, the model learned from the past data before making predictions for 2016, reducing the overprediction as in the case of the other two models.  The neural network has a learning algorithm to handle subjectivity and uncertainty. Although the accuracy difference is small, the model is expected to evolve in the following years. Sensitivity analysis is considered one of the refined methods. Having a sophisticated tool in urban prediction is essential because false alarms may result in huge economic loss and serious social unrest.  Given the trend of increasing urban sprawl, realistic prediction outputs contribute to sustainable urban development.

**Discussion**

Research Comparison: the two methods I select are complimentary in answering my research question on the progress of India’s urbanization. The first methodology measures current urban areas at a national level, specifying India’s population distribution and urban footprints. It encourages city planners to devise programs based on the urbanization process. The article answer my research question of understanding urban dynamic in India. It also mentions OpenStreetMap, which we’ve discussed in class.  Datasets for mapping urban areas are scarce compared to other ones, and the paper aims to fill this gap. Nevertheless, there is one limitation in the analysis that can be improved. The sampled examples mostly come from densely-populated regions, ignoring remote areas. The second methodology provides a good modeling tool in predicting urban growth as it handles the uncertainties and produces realistic outputs. This allows local governments to select the most sensible programs for urban development. However, some features of this methodology is subjective to yield inaccurate results. 
The research gap I have encountered is to propose sustainable urban planning that reduces inequality and poverty in India. Comparing the Random Forest method to NNACA model, NNACA based urban models remain a popular technique. Since both methods generate prediction outputs with high level of accuracy, they are helpful to assess the viability of government policies.
My research question is “what factors characterize urbanization in India and what can these factors do to future urban planning.” With sub-questions guiding me to answer the question, my final paper displays the progress of India’s urbanization and the trend of urban growth.
